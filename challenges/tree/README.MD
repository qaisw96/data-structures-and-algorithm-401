# Trees

Tree : is a non-linear data structure allows us to store, search , add values or nodes with efficient Time complexity  

## Challenge

+ Create a BinaryTree class with three traversal methods
+ Create a BinarySearchTree class that have two methods, one for add nodes, and another for searching for a value 

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O ==> O( log n ) 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
